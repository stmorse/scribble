Everybody knows Simon & Garfunkel's style: tight harmonies over precisely fingerpicked guitar.  Their songs are a good way to learn fingerpicking (i.e. playing with just your fingers, no pick), and Scarborough Fair may be one of their simplest.  I'll walk through the tab so we can focus on just learning the dang thing, then at the end discuss some theory for a deeper understanding of what we're playing.

Learning any song is a research experience.  Try looking up other tabs online, see where they differ, watch S&G play it live, try fooling around with the licks, etc.  It's all part of the fun, and you end up with a really cool appreciation of the song.

# THE SETUP:

The song is played in standard tuning, so E-A-D-G-B-E from low (fat) string to high (thin) string.  Sidenote: Feel free to use a tuner, but really work on not being shackled to one.  Getting the low E to be exactly an E isn't as important as getting all the strings to be in tune with each other – getting the intervals right.  The fifth-fret trick is the best.

The song is also played with a capo on the 7th fret.  You can play the song without a capo (if you don't have one, say), or place it somewhere else to suit your voice, no big deal, it will just sound different than a recording of S&G.


## TABS PRIMER:

Tabs look intimidating at first, but they're really straightforward.  For example, this:

```
e|--0---|
B|--1---|
G|--0---|
D|--2---|
A|--3---|
E|------|
```

means press the A-string on the 3rd fret, the D-string on the 2nd fret, leave the G-string open, press the B-string on the 1st fret, then strum or pluck all five strings simultaneously.  Hey! - that's a C chord in tab-form.  Sometimes you won't get the labels on what each string is tuned to – assume it's standard tuning unless specified otherwise.  

There are a couple symbols used commonly in tabs, like the hammer-on (`h`), pull-off (`p`), and bend (`b` or `^`).  (Although it's not like there's a style manual on tabs, so sometimes you'll see `^` for hammer-on or something weird.)  

Hammer-on is plucking a note on a particular string, and then hammering your finger on a higher fret on the same string without plucking again.  So one pluck, two notes in succession.  Pull-off is the opposite: plucking on the higher fret and pulling that finger off to a lower fret or the open string.

```
e|----------|
B|----0h1---|
G|----------|
D|----0h2---|
A|--0-------|
E|----------|
```

Notice in this example you're plucking the D- and B-string open, simultaneously, and then simultaneously hammering your fingers onto the 2nd and 1st fret of those strings (without plucking again).  Also check out that open A-string note at the beginning – you can pluck that and let it ring while you play the hammer on chord.  It's a nice sound, and something you will see again in Scarborough Fair.  Onto the song.  Full tab first, then we'll go part-by-part.
