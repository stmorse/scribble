title: Teaching R in a beginner data science class

I recently got talked into helping with a winter-term, student-led course on software tools for optimization and analytics, put together by colleagues in the [OR Center](http://orc.mit.edu) at MIT.  It was a great experience, and was a confidence boost for the actual teaching I'll be doing in the fall.  

However, the path from "hey let's switch up the course this year" to "good morning class" was winding and full of interesting revelations for me.  So I wanted to sum up some observations, and shamelessly link to my [course notes](https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2017/2_wrangling_and_viz/S2_master.html) (which are awesome).

1. Data wrangling and visualization should be covered together.
2. The Tidyverse is hard to self-teach.
3. The "get a bigger hammer" philosophy doesn't work in the Tidyverse.
4. Long vs. Wide (i.e. what "tidy data" means) is the inflection point for deeper understanding.
5. I missed Python.
