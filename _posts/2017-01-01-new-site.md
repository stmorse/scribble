I am now running my personal site using Jekyll, hosted by Github Pages.  I modded a theme I found [here](https://github.com/muan/muan.github.com/releases) and [here](https://github.com/muan/jekyll-wardrobe).  Feel free to fork my version or the original.

This post is mainly a test page for different theme/format elements.

A code block looks like this:

```python
import numpy as np
u = np.random.rand()
if u < 0.1:
  print 'Dang'
```

and inline code looks like `this`.

We have *italics*, **bold**, and ***italicized bold (?)*** text.

Some lists are

1. Who's on first?
2. Yes.
3. That's what I asked you.

and a blockquote is

> A man, a plan, Bob Loblaw.

Testing some math formatting inline $$\sum_i x_i^2$$ and block...

$$\lambda_{ij} = \sum_i \sum_j f(i,j)$$

That'll probably do it for now.
