<hr>

<p>I'm a second-year Masters student in the [Operations Research Center](http://orc.mit.edu) at MIT.  Following this program, I will serve as an Instructor at the [U.S. Military Academy (West Point)](http://www.usma.edu) for 3 years teaching sophomore-level calculus.  My current research is in complex networks, in particular the spread of information and influence through a social network.  This research is a nice mix of complex networks, machine learning, optimization, large-scale data science, and I really enjoy it.</p>
    
<p>I am also an active-duty military officer.  I commissioned in 2008 from West Point, and have served in Afghanistan (1 year) as a rifle platoon leader, and Kuwait (10 months) as an infantry company commander.  I've also held various staff positions at the Company, Brigade, and Division level.  After completing my tour as a West Point instructor, I plan to return to the operational Army and running around in the woods with guns.</p>

<p>I'm also passionate about guitar, piano, hiking, traveling, languages, chess, hunting, reading, and good bourbon.  My backup career plan is to professionally busk.  I recently co-authored a neural network with my wife; we named him Isaac and he loves blueberries.</p>
