<hr>

<p>I'm a second-year Masters student in the <a href="http://orc.mit.edu">Operations Research Center</a> at MIT.  Following this program, I will serve as an Instructor at the <a href="http://www.usma.edu">U.S. Military Academy</a> (West Point) for 3 years teaching calculus.  I am currently doing research with MIT's <a href="http://humnet.mit.edu">HuMNet Lab</a> and the <a href="http://www.draper.com">Draper Laboratory</a> in complex networks, in particular the spread of information and influence through a social network.  This research is a nice mix of complex networks, machine learning, optimization, large-scale data science, and I really enjoy it.</p>
    
<p>I am also an active-duty military officer.  I commissioned in 2008 from West Point, and have served in Afghanistan as a rifle platoon leader, and Kuwait as an infantry company commander.  I've also held various staff positions at the Company, Brigade, and Division level.  After completing my tour as a West Point instructor, I plan to return to the operational Army and running around in the woods with guns.</p>

<p>I'm also passionate about guitar, piano, hiking, traveling, languages, chess, hunting, reading, and good bourbon.  My backup career plan is to professionally busk.  I recently co-authored a neural network with my wife; we named him Isaac and he loves blueberries.</p>
